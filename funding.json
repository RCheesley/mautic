This proposal aims to add ability to the Mautic core in a way so that transport plugins can leverage them and map it more precisely to the Mautic core model.\n\nWe are looking for funding for implementation of the solution proposed in this document.\n\nProposed Solution\n\nFor the problem described above we are suggesting that we add a complaint flag into the DNC entity so transport plugins can use it when the provider (Omnivery, Mailgun, etc.) suggests so.\n\nWe would also like to introduce soft bounces into Mautic core in a way so that we still send to contacts that soft bounces, but if the soft bounce happens multiple times that translates to the DNC entity for that lead with a hard bounced flag.\n\nHow many times contact soft bounces consecutively before it translates to hard bounced is configurable with the setting in Configuration -> Email Settings.\n\nWe introduce soft bounce categories so that transport plugins can categorize and we can display that data to the end user.\n\nWe would add the following filters on segments: filter for DNC complaint reason, soft bounce filter and soft bounce of specific category.\n\nWe would like to show some more statistics about bounced, soft bounced and complaint contacts on the email list page.\n\nWe would like to show the count of soft bounces & complaints on the contact page. Also show how many soft bounces until the hard bounce for the given contact and to show the count of soft bounces & complaints on email list view.",
